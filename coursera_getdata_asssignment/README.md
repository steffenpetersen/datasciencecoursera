===========================

An R script to produce tidy datasets from raw datasets from the experiment "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set"[1]

## How to use it

Open the script with R and set the working directory to the directory where the raw experiment data is located using:

```R
setwd('the directory')
```

The script will produce two new space-separated text files (tidy-data-meanstd.txt and tidy-data-averages.txt) containing the two tidy datasets. Refer to CodeBook.md for details on the structure of the tidy datasets.
